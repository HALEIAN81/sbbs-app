        "I believe, life itself is the greatest mystery - but to add our own unique experiences 
        and creative endeavors is to uncover that mystery every day" - Hale Verde. 

        The story of Jackson, Jira and Melissa is a budding story of individual heroism, dedication and the 
        depthness of character even in the world of fiction. I hope that those that read our book (and those that follow)
        can share in that journey and make it their own. BlueHand is a mysterious force and as we work through the series
        I hope that our readers will discover a love for that 'unwinding' of their mystery and learn more about Scotland, 
        Washington and as such - Scotland Backyard.

        Please look out for Scotland Backyard - Volume II - The Warlock's Cabal coming out Q3 2023 on Amazon. 

        Thank you all for supporting this journey.
