                Towering evergreens claw at the sky, framing the anomaly nestled
                in their midst – Scotland, Washington. Wedged between Bremerton
                and Poulsbo, the town breathes in the scent of saltwater and the
                rhythmic pounding of distant drills. Whispers of classified Navy
                projects hang heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of sea
                salt, hinting at secrets buried beneath the surface. A single
                road cuts through the dense forest, a lifeline snaking through
                whispers of ancient mysteries and chilling tales carried on the
                wind. In Scotland, WA, the extraordinary bleeds seamlessly into
                the ordinary. Every shadow seems to hold a story, waiting for a
                curious soul to unearth it.

                Since the 1920s, BlueHand Corporation has quietly established
                itself as a dominant force in the town. Its reach extends far
                beyond what's visible, supplying the military, funding research
                in tech, medicine, and even esoteric fields like advanced
                physics, quantum mechanics, and artificial intelligence. But
                beneath this veneer of progress lies a shrouded purpose. No one
                knows BlueHand's true mission, but suspicion has driven Jackson
                and Jiro to dedicate their youth to uncovering the corporation's
                dark secrets.

                Scotland, Washington, is a place where the veil between reality
                and the strange seems to be perpetually thin. The town simmers
                with a unique energy fueled by a confluence of factors. The Navy
                conducts shadowy experiments, whispers surround "accidental
                mishaps" at BlueHand's clandestine labs, and Scotland University
                nurtures a population of hyper-intelligent students. The town
                acts as a magnet, drawing the greatest minds from across the
                globe – a perfect recipe for what locals have affectionately
                dubbed "The Weirdness." But the strangeness goes deeper. Ancient
                groups stake their claim on the town's scattered Native American
                ruins, while whispers of secret societies – vampires,
                werewolves, and even immortals – add another layer to the town's
                mystique. In Scotland, Washington, "The Weirdness" isn't just a
                quirk; it's the very essence of the place.

                From the shrouded deserts of New Mexico emerges a clandestine
                unit – a shadow organization tasked with a singular purpose: the
                capture and containment of the extraordinary. Their origins are
                as shrouded as the technology they wield. Colonel Stone, an
                enigma himself, leads this ruthless band with an iron fist. But
                what truly fuels their relentless pursuit? Are they guardians or
                hunters? One thing is certain: when they set their sights on
                something, blood may well be spilled.
