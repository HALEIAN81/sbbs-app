<p className="newsTitleContent p1">
Towering mountains frame Scotland, Washington, a town wedged between Bremerton and Poulsbo like an anomaly nestled amidst towering pines. Whispers of classified Navy projects mingle with the scent of saltwater and echoing drills, hinting at secrets buried deep within. A single road pierces the dense forests, winding like a lifeline through ancient mysteries and chilling tales whispered on the wind. This is Scotland, WA, a place where the extraordinary bleeds into the ordinary, and every shadow seems to hold a story waiting to be unearthed.

Between the Navy's experiments and 'accidental mishaps' of BlueHand's secret labs,
the Scotland University's bolstering hyper-smart young college students and that the area
seems to attract the greatest minds from all over the world and you have yourself a formula
for what has been affectionately called "The Weirdness". Put that together with ancient groups
laying claim to the Native American ruins strown about the town, the secret societies of
would-be vampires, werewolves, immortals and yes, "The Weirdness" begins to have meaning.
