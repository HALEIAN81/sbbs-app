<p className="newsTitleContent p1">
There exist mysterious towns and cities and then there is Scotland, Washington. Nestled in the heart of McGregor County, lies our humble city-town.
Founded by the McGregor family and fashioned with a boost from the gold rush and the silver rush, little Scotland, WA quickly became big Scotland, WA helped
out even more by the riches and ambitions of BlueHand Corporation, a corporation dedicated to the "Benefit of All Mankind". Home to families, the Navy and
Marines, it is both a place of love and expectation, but also of thrills and adventure. At some point, even the Vikings may have called it home.
Surrounded by mountains, bounded by the shores of the Pacific Ocean and nested within the ethos of the Pacific NorthWest, USA.
