<p className="newsTitleContent p1">
There exist mysterious towns and cities and then there is Scotland, Washington. Nestled in the heart of McGregor County, lies our humble city-town.
Founded by the McGregor family and fashioned with a boost from the gold rush and the silver rush, little Scotland, WA quickly became big Scotland, WA helped
out even more by the riches and ambitions of BlueHand Corporation, a corporation dedicated to the "Benefit of All Mankind". Home to families, the Navy and
Marines, it is both a place of love and expectation, but also of thrills and adventure. At some point, even the Vikings may have called it home.
Surrounded by mountains, bounded by the shores of the Pacific Ocean and nested within the ethos of the Pacific NorthWest, USA.

BlueHand Corporation isn't your typical villain. They don't wear black capes or cackle maniacally. Their ambition is far more insidious – a slow, calculated infiltration. They've woven themselves into the very fabric of Scotland, Washington – the hospital, the schools, even the military contracts. Their motives remain shrouded, but their influence is undeniable. Is their ultimate goal to control the town... or to use it as a sinister testing ground for something far more sinister?  Can our young heroes possibly unravel BlueHand's web of control before it's too late? The fight for Scotland, Washington is a fight for freedom itself, and the outcome hangs in the balance.

Scotland, Washington – a town shrouded in a veil of peculiarity.

Did these oddities escape the clutches of BlueHand Corporation's sprawling research labs, or perhaps from the enigmatic Scotland United University? The lines between scientific innovation and monstrous creation blur in this town.  The question of who – or what – is responsible hangs heavy in the air, a chilling precursor to a potential nightmare.

<p className="card-content">
Coach Gary Adams bleeds hockey. From cheering on the pros to coaching high school, the rink is his second home. Now, a twist of fate (or a questionable call by the athletic director) has landed him as the head coach of the Scotland United Middle School team.  Undeterred, Coach Adams sees an opportunity to mold young talent into future stars.  He's got his sights set on making these middle schoolers a national force – even if their rivals, the Midland Cobras, have a mascot with questionable dance moves. So, when the team starts acting strangely just before the season, Coach Adams takes it in stride. After all, it wouldn't be hockey in Scotland, Washington without a dash of the unexpected. Get ready for a season filled with grit, determination, and maybe even a few glowing pucks – this is Scotland Hockey!

Nurse Mallory is the rock of Scotland Middle School. CPR? Check. Bandaging scraped knees? In her sleep. Dispersing cough syrup and teenage angst? All in a day's work. But nothing in her training prepared her for the recent influx of...unusual ailments.  It seems silver isn't just a fashion statement for her watch anymore.  And are those fangs peeking out from behind little Timmy's braces?  Full moon blues or genuine lycanthropy? Nurse Mallory's got her work cut out for her.  Between dodging potential bloodsuckers and calming down werewolf meltdowns, one thing's for sure: this school nurse has seen it all (and maybe even a little more than she bargained for).

The aroma of Mrs. Peabody's Salisbury steak with creamed peas is enough to lure even the pickiest eater.  Carrot and beef stew simmers cheerfully, promising a hearty lunch.  And for dessert? A scoop of mint ice cream studded with "almond shivers" (don't ask, don't tell).  The cafeteria ladies at Scotland United Middle School are culinary magicians...almost.  Sure, the garlic might be a bit on the shy side (ahem, vampires?), and the definition of "medium-rare" seems to be a moving target.  But hey, when your classmates include a mysterious new student with glowing eyes and a lunch lady with a suspiciously silver necklace, who can be too picky?  One thing's for sure – lunchtime at Scotland United is an adventure for the taste buds and the imagination.

Scotland United Middle School wasn't always a place of textbooks and teenage angst.

However, time and circumstance transformed this monument to chivalry into a center of learning.  Yet, beneath the polished facade and sleek glass redesign lies a heart of mystery.  The very foundation rests upon a network of unexplored tunnels, a relic of its former glory.  These shadowed passageways serve as an unseen meeting ground, a place where the whispers of history mingle with the murmurs of...stranger groups.  What secrets lie hidden within these walls?  What unseen forces gather in the darkness below?  Scotland United Middle School may be a school, but its legacy is steeped in intrigue, a breeding ground for the extraordinary waiting to be unearthed.
